The wording combined with the number values assigned to the example colors don't help at all with understanding the actual task. Remove the number values given to the example colors, and just say, if the darker color is the goal, what percentage of the way there is the lighter color. Giving the examples number values makes the user ask the question, well what color would 100 be? How do I determine the number values of the colors in the actual questions? When in reality, the number values of the colors in the questions don't mater at all, just the percentage of how far along the lighter color is to becoming as dark as the darker one."
